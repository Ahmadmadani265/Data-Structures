Q1) Given an array of integers from 1 to N (some numbers may be missing),use a HashSet to find all missing numbers.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 4, 6], N = 6
Output: [3, 5]


Q2) Given an array and a target sum, find all unique pairs of numbers that add up to the target. 
Use a HashSet to improve efficiency.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 3], target = 6
Output: [(2, 4), (3, 3)]

Q3) Given two arrays of integers,count how many distinct elements are common between them using HashSet.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 2


Q4) Given two strings, find the characters that are uncommon between them 
using a HashSet.
Example:
Input: "abcd", "afgh"
Output: [b, c, d, f, g, h]


Q5) Given a string, remove adjacent duplicates using a HashSet 
to keep track of previously seen characters.
Example:
Input: "aabccbaa"
Output: "abcba"
