# ðŸ§  Data Structures Implementation in Java

This repository contains clean and minimal implementations of classic data structures using Java â€” built entirely from scratch without using Java's built-in collections. The goal is to understand internal mechanics, memory layout, and algorithmic behavior of each structure.

## ðŸš€ Implemented Data Structures

### ðŸ”¹ Linear Structures
- `MyArrayList<T>` â€” Dynamic array list (resizable array)
- `MyLinkedList<T>` â€” Singly linked list
- `MyStack<T>` â€” Stack using array or linked list
- `MyQueue<T>` â€” Queue with array or linked list

### ðŸ”¹ Non-Linear Structures *(optional/coming soon)*
- `MyBinaryTree<T>` â€” Binary Tree / Binary Search Tree
- `MyGraph<T>` â€” Graph with adjacency list

### ðŸ”¹ Hash-Based Structures
- `MyHashMap<K, V>` â€” Basic hash map (open addressing or chaining)
- `MyHashSet<T>` â€” Set implementation

## âœ¨ Features

- Fully generic (`<T>`) implementation
- Custom dynamic memory resizing (e.g., in `MyArrayList`)
- Element insertion, deletion, search, update
- No use of `java.util.*` (pure core Java)
- Educational focus: code is kept simple and readable
